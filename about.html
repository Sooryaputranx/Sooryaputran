        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Sooryaputran is a digital explorer, innovator, and coder who draws inspiration from the cosmic power of the Sun to energize his relentless pursuit of knowledge and technology. With a passion for harnessing the forces of nature and logic, he builds systems that are as efficient as they are elegant.</p>
        <p>His journey bridges the mystical energy of ancient solar traditions with the logical precision of modern programming. In his world, lines of code are not just instructions — they are extensions of creative energy and intentional design. He is fascinated by the endless possibilities of artificial intelligence, decentralized systems, ethical hacking, and automation, and channels his curiosity into real-world projects that aim to inspire, protect, and empower.</p>
        <p>When he’s not crafting code or analyzing systems, Sooryaputran is connecting with like-minded creators, learning emerging technologies, and sharing knowledge to build a tech community that thrives on innovation, security, and sustainability.</p>
